### Hi there! I'm Neal

I have a B.S. in Mathematics Education with a Physics Education minor. I spent six years teaching Math and Physics classes in two low-income schools. In that time I began to pick up some basic coding skills and realized that programming was a field that I enjoyed even more than teaching. I decided to make the career change and chose Lambda School to help me. Since December 2019 I have been vastly increasing my understanding of statistics and data science and I look forward to the continued journey toward becoming an expert.
